        <p>The <em><strong>Rhetus Periander Butterfly</strong></em> is awesome because of its unique <strong>vivid blue coloration</strong>.<br>
        Blue is the coolest color on earth as it reminds us of nature, water, space, and the sky,<br>
        Butterflies and their <em>glittery beauty</em> are symbols of change and transformation, comfort, hope, and positivity.<br>
        This is why the combination is the <em>coolest</em> to the eye.<br>
        </p>

        <p>According to Wikipedia, <em>Rhetus Periander Butterfly</em> is the commonest and most widespread butterfly,<br>
         which belongs to the <em>Rhetus</em> family <em>Riodinidae.</em><br>
        It is found in most of Central America and South America, ranging from Mexico to Brazil and Argentina.<br>
    <strong>They are fast flying, strikingly iridescent, and have long wing tails.</strong> <br>
        Their ability to live under leaves makes it hard to notice them despite their <strong><em>vivid blue coloration</em></strong>.
